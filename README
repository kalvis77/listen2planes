 * 
 * This software package was designed for Satellite Laser Ranging stations but could
 * be adapted for general use. It is intended for use with the SBS-3 receiver, supplied
 * by Kinetic Avionics.
 * 
 * You should begin by running the listen2planes server, l2pserver.  This makes a
 * connection to the SBS-3 receiver and requires the IP address and port number of
 * the raw data stream or alternatively the raw output from the BaseStation software
 * package.  The IP address for the SBS-3 is setup through BaseStation initially by
 * connecting via USB.  Enter the IP address and port as l2pserver command line arguments
 * along with the elevation cut off.
 * 
 * Once the l2pserver is running it will accept connections on the port 2020 and the
 * IP address of the operating PC. A connection can be made using the l2pclient, the
 * l2pgui display or by TCP/IP to develop your own application
 * 
 * The l2pserver serves updates containing latitude, longitude, altitude and velocity
 * components of the detected aircraft.  It also calculates their azimuth, elevation and
 * range and so a reference latitude, longitude and altitude are required for the origin
 * station used.  In addition the equivalent geocentric XYZ coordinates must also be input.
 * These are required by both l2pserver and l2pclient and have the prefix STAT_.
 * 
 * The l2pclient can be run in 2 modes, controlled by the variable 'YNclient'.  If this
 * variable is FALSE the  client will communicate as a 'reader' and only output the
 * aircraft as text to the screen.  If this variable is TRUE then the client is identified
 * as 'client' and will provide warnings of approaching aircraft.  This requires an
 * additional connection to l2pserver to update the azimuth and elevation direction of the
 * laser telescope. The size and shape of the warning area around aircraft can be adjusted
 * by changing the predict ahead times and the bndry and tri variables set in degrees.
 * 
 * The example code l2ptelesc_example.c connects to the l2pserver and deposits the
 * telescope direction angles.  This code should be adapted or an equivalent coded in
 * another language written to take regular telescope updates from the operating SLR system
 * and provided them to the server using the same format so that it can then supply this
 * information to its  applications.
 *
 * To download the l2pgui visual display written in Python that connects to the l2pserver
 * visit https://github.com/jcrod/l2pGUI.
 * 
 * This software is provided freely for the benefit of the SLR community.  Please
 * make available any further developments or applications.
